<HTML><BODY>The Author of this book, José Rizal (1861-1896), is the Philippine national hero. Descending from a middle-class Filipino-Chinese family, he soon
attracted attention because of his high intelligence and artistic qualities.
He studied at the Ateneo de Manila, and after that traveled to Spain, to
study Medicin at the Universidad Central de Madrid.

<p>Already at young age, he spoke up for freedom and equal rights for Filipinos.
The Philippines, at that time still a Spanish possession, where ruled in a
brutal fashion by corrupt officials and Spanish priests. In his first "Novel",
Noli me tangere, written in Spanish, he exposed those practices. The book was
printed and published in Berlin, in 1887, and send to the Philippines from there. The book was almost immediately banned by the local authorities. In 1891, El Filibusterismo appeared in Ghent, a more explicit and rasher sequel to this work.

<p>His works raised the anger of the Spanish authorities and Catholic priests in
the Philippines. At the same time they became a source of inspiration for
armed resistance. At first, Rizal was exiled to the South of the Philippines, but eventually, he was sentenced to death after a fake trial, and executed on 30 December 1896 in Manila. After his execution, the rebellion fully broke loose, and the Spanish rules where unable to control the situation. The Americans, who saw an opportunity, took over the colony, with some military show of power, for 20 million dollars in 1898. After that, they needed over 10 years to suppress the rebellion--with a lot of violence and probably more deaths than 300 years of Spanish rule.

<p>Even though Rizal never raised arms, and only argued for equal rights and reforms, in the Philippines he is seen as a freedom fighter and national hero. In every town you can find a statue of him, and a street named after him.

<p>This translation to the French, from 1899, is the first translation of his novel in any foreign language I know of. The first English translation only appeared a year later, and the first Tagalog translation appeared in 1906.

<p>A few pages are badly printed, and may require the reconstruction of a few letters on the right or left side of the page.</BODY></HTML>
